# Languages
Even though languages can mean `internationalization` in this context with "languages" "programming languages" are meant.

### Files in the directory

* ##### languages.json
  > The `languages.json`-file is a file that stores the different versions of the programming language names.
  > This is, because the extension is internally using the filenames for the programming languages and not their written names for humans. So it uses `cpp` instead of `C++`.
  > This file is storing all of the different filenames and the actual names so that these can be converted and a human can read it.
  > So when inputted `c` there will be `C` and with `csharp` there will be `C#`.
