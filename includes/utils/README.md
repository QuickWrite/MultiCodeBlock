# Utilities
In this folder there are different files that include different functions. These functions are more designed to be used as functions for data or just the framework and not the code logic of the MediaWiki extension.

### Files in the directory

* ##### getData.php
  > The `getData`-file combines utility functions that are returning data that the extension uses for the core logic.

* ##### HTMLFramework.php
  > The `HTMLFramework`-file combines utility functions that are returning just HTML that is more a framework around the generated and more static than dynamic content.
  > This is more used as a cleanup of the core logic.
